# statusfuckery
This is a PHP implementation of [@joho](https://github.com/joho)'s proposed [7XX HTTP Status Codes](https://github.com/joho/7XX-rfc)

To use this, just php-include this file on every page of your website:

```<?php include "statusfuckery.php" ?>```

It will then choose one of the Status Codes randomly from an array.
